This code is a multi-motor control system based on STM32F10x, mainly used for controlling brushless motors, stepper motors and achieving vehicle motion control. Here is an analysis of the overall architecture: 
Core Architecture
1. Hardware Driver Layer
CAN Communication (MyCAN.c/h): Used for receiving control instructions 
Serial Port Communication (usart.c/h): Debugging and Data Transmission 
DAC8568 (DAC8568.c/h): 16-bit DAC for controlling the speed of brushless motors 
Stepper Motor Driver (STEP.c/h): Controls the movement of stepper motors 
GPIO control: Various enable, brake, and direction control pins 
2. Communication Protocol
CAN Bus Protocol: Main Control Channel, Standard Frame with ID of 0x11 
Modbus-like protocol: Custom instruction format AC 03 [Function code] [Data] [CRC] 
3. Control Function Module
Motion Control (Control_motor())
Forward/Backward: Controlled by brushless motor speed. 
Steering control: Stepper motor controls left and right steering. 
Gear control: 5 speed gears (0-4 gears) 
Brake system: Mechanical brake control 
Motor Control Function
Brushspeed(): Brushless Motor PWM Speed Control 
BrushDIR(): Direction Control 
control_dir(): Overall steering control 
control_step(): Extension rod control 
brake()/Outbrake(): Brake Control 
back()/Outback(): Reverse Control 
4. Data Flow text
CAN reception → Instruction parsing → Motor control → Status feedback
5. Instruction format example c
// Forward command: AC 03 01 01 01 [CRC]
// Turning command: AC 03 05 01 01 [CRC]
// Speed setting: AC 03 04 00 02 [CRC] (2nd gear)
6. Safety features
CRC verification ensures the integrity of the commands 
Emergency stop brake function 
Software reset mechanism
